# Overview
Much of my work this summer centered around gathering and analyzing experimental data; this includes figuring out what experimental data to take in the first place. As such, my folder in the repo is divided into three sub-folders: finding_states, testing_experiment (analyzing experimental data for W/W' and neural net/population model performance), and calibration (tex file for calibration/troubleshooting manual I wrote). Below, I give more info on specific files and uses of each:

## finding_states
This folder contains code to determine what states we should gather experimental data on. 
### important files:
- 

## testing_experiment
This folder contains code to analyze experimental data and neural net/population model performance.

## calibration
This folder contains the Tex file for the calibration/troubleshooting document I created.
