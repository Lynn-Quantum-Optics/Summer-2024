See my folder for an in-depth Read Me on each section!
- calibration -> pdf/tex of a full 'how to calibrate everything' calibration tutorial! This is also found in the calibration folder, and contains both what to run and common troubleshooting tricks.
- finding_states -> all of my code for theoretically finding states that we can experimentally create and produce +W, -W'.
- testing experiment -> all of my code for analyzing experimental data, both for W/W' and for NN/population model.
