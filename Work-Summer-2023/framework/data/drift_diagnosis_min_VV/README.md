This experiment was an early attempt to diagnose the drift as a result of the UVHWP warming up throughout the experiment. I used a script to determine the UVHWP angle that minimizes VV counts, meaning we would be producing only the V state prior to BBO incidence. If the UVHWP were heating up/drifting, then the V state would drift away from V and the angle that minimizes coincidence counts should shift.

In my brilliance, I for some reason decided that I should _warm up the laser_ while leaving it blocked, a decision which likely saved us a few days of trying to figure out what the heck was happening. If I had not warmed up the laser, this experiment may have revealed a significant drift (which we now know is due to the _laser_) that we would have mis-attributed to the UVHWP.

After this experiment, we wrote the drift experiment script which became the main tool for analyzing the laser drift going forwards.
